# Enhanced Command-Line Game: Snake - Water - Gun with Sound Effects

In this creative command-line game project, we're crafting an elevated version of "Snake - Water - Gun" that combines interactive gameplay with engaging sound effects and delightful text patterns.
The classic game premise involves players selecting from three options - snake, water, or gun - to compete against the computer. The game dynamics include snake overpowering water, water extinguishing gun, and gun prevailing over snake.
# Key Features
The game is coded using Python and runs within the command-line environment.
Players interact with the game through text-based inputs and receive responses accompanied by exciting sound effects.
Visual appeal is heightened through well-designed text patterns and formatting.
An interactive loop allows participants to continue playing rounds as long as they desire.
The computer's choice is randomized for each round, adding an element of surprise to the game.
User selections and outcomes are displayed in a visually pleasing format.
Sound effects are triggered using the winsound library, enhancing the immersive experience (note: on Windows systems, ensure you have the pywin32 module installed for sound support).

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you clone and set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Cloning the Repository
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
3. Run the following command:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project-name.git

### Now Follow the instructions given below

1. **Open the Project in Visual Studio Code**:

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (Optional but recommended):

   - Open the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code by clicking on "View" in the top menu and selecting "Terminal".
   - In the terminal, navigate to your project directory if you're not already there.

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/project
   ```

   - Create a virtual environment named "venv" (you can replace "venv" with your preferred name):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:

     On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

     On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Required Packages from `requirements.txt`**:

   - With the virtual environment activated, install the required packages using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This command will install all the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

4. **Running the Project**:

   - Once the packages are installed, you can run your project using the terminal:

   ```bash
   python Snake_water_gun.py
   ```
The game should start running, and you can now play the Snake-Water-Gun game right from your terminal!
