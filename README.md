# Enhanced Command-Line Game: Snake - Water - Gun with Sound Effects

In this creative command-line game project, we're crafting an elevated version of "Snake - Water - Gun" that combines interactive gameplay with engaging sound effects and delightful text patterns.
The classic game premise involves players selecting from three options - snake, water, or gun - to compete against the computer. The game dynamics include snake overpowering water, water extinguishing gun, and gun prevailing over snake.
# Key Features

Players interact with the game through text-based inputs and receive responses accompanied by exciting sound effects.
Visual appeal is heightened through well-designed text patterns and formatting.
An interactive loop allows participants to continue playing rounds as long as they desire.
The computer's choice is randomized for each round, adding an element of surprise to the game.

Sound effects are triggered using the winsound library, enhancing the immersive experience (note: on Windows systems, ensure you have the pywin32 module installed for sound support).
